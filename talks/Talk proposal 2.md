# Accessibility and UI testing – two sides of the same coin?

### Description

Accessibility and UI testing are two very important, but seemingly unrelated concepts in Flutter app development - but what if I told you that they're very closely coupled?

---

Accessibility is no longer just an option - regulations such as the European Accessibility Act (EAA) mandate that a huge range of products and services must be accessible to people with disabilities. EAA will become law in all of EU in June 2025, and if you're a developer working on a non-trivial app, chances are you'll have to implement accessibility support.

This might sound like a yet another boring task, but I suggest to change the perspective and look at it as an opportunity – because well-implemented accessibility makes end-to-end UI testing easy and mostly effortless.

Why? If you think about how an end-to-end UI test really works, you'll see many parallels to the way people with disabilities interact with their devices using systems such as VoiceOver.

In this session, you'll learn how to take advantage of your Flutter app being accessible to develop end-to-end UI tests with almost no effort. I'll also show the problems and limits of accessibility on mobile when it comes to using it for UI testing. I plan to end with a quick glimpse into the future of UI testing and what we're working on at mobile.dev to solve those issues.

### Share your experience with this topic

I'm a software developer and a Computer Science student with a few years of expertise in Flutter, both in app and tooling development. I was the main developer of the Patrol testing framework (I gave a talk about it on last year's Fluttercon), which is at ~800 GitHub stars and has been enabling Flutter developers finally fully E2E test their apps.

Right now, I'm a software engineering intern at mobile.dev, working on the Maestro UI testing framework and other initiatives in the mobile QA space.

I'm also a member of the #flutter-hackers group (people with commit access in the Flutter org on GitHub), and over the past year I've created ~100 pull requests and issues, mainly related to Flutter's integration with Gradle on Android and better support for UI testing. I also maintain several popular projects in the Flutter ecosystem, such as package:flutter_downloader, package:location and the Flutter GitHub Action (subosito/flutter-action), and have contributed to many more throughout the years.

I run a modest blog at https://garden.pacia.tech, where I sometimes post about the Flutter/Dart ecosystem.
