# The elephant under the hood - how Flutter uses Gradle to build your apps

Do you scream and beg for mercy every time you have to edit `build.gradle` in your Flutter app? If so, then this talk is for you!

Gradle is a build system of choice for Android apps, including those built with Flutter.

It's well-established, powerful, and open-source. It's also a bit infamous for some of the (non)ocassional problems that occur with it. It's not going away anytime soon though, so let's learn with it on good terms!

Takeaways:
- Quick intro to Gradle: projects, tasks, dependencies
- How Flutter apps for Android are actually built
- How Flutter plugins on Android are included in your app
- What is Flutter Gradle Plugin (FGP)
- What Flutter team does to make build process on Android easier, faster, and more reliable
- What does the future hold for Flutter build tooling

### Share your experience with this topic

I'm a software developer and a Computer Science student with a few years of expertise in Flutter, both in app and tooling development. I was the main developer of the Patrol testing framework (I gave a talk about it on last year's Fluttercon), which is at ~800 GitHub stars and has been enabling Flutter developers finally fully E2E test their apps.

Right now, I'm a software engineering intern at mobile.dev, working on the Maestro UI testing framework and other initiatives in the mobile QA space.

I'm also a member of the #flutter-hackers group (people with commit access in the Flutter org on GitHub), and over the past year I've created ~100 pull requests and issues, mainly related to Flutter's integration with Gradle on Android and better support for UI testing. I also maintain several popular projects in the Flutter ecosystem, such as package:flutter_downloader, package:location and the Flutter GitHub Action (subosito/flutter-action), and have contributed to many more throughout the years.

I run a modest blog at https://garden.pacia.tech, where I sometimes post about the Flutter/Dart ecosystem.
