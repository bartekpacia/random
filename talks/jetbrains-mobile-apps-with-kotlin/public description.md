### Title

Mobile development with the expressive power of Kotlin

### Brief description

Kotlin is a modern programming language developed by JetBrains.
It's safe, powerful, and flexible.
One of its most popular use-cases is building mobile apps with the Jetpack
Compose framework.

In this workshop, we will quickly get up to speed Kotlin, and then with Jetpack
Compose. But after writing a few simple layouts, we'll take a step back and
understand how Kotlin's powerful features make a DSL of Jetpack Compose work at
all, including extension functions, functions with receivers, scopes, and more!
