# Notes

I have 2 hours, with a break in between. It's quite a lot of time.

Talk with 2 parts:
- practical "DIY" when we all together build an app
- how does it actually work under the hood

### Part 2

But don't you wonder how does it actually work? 

We just a bunch of function, these functions don't return anything.
But yet something is rendered on the screen, and in a very fast, optimized way.
How does it actually work?

Now, brace yourselves.
