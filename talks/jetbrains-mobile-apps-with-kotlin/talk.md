# Notes

I have 2 hours, with a break in between. It's quite a lot of time.

Talk with 2 parts:
- practical "DIY" part when we all build an app together
- more lecture-y part how does it actually work under the hood

# Part 1

Now, mobile development is known for requiring much heavier tooling than
frontend â€“ so I'll introduce myself real quick, then we'll quickly download
Android Studio, and in the meantime I'll say a bit about JetBrains.

- We have internships

  It's quite unfortunate because they just finished last week :(

- We're looking for a student ambassador at FEUP

# Part 2

But don't you wonder how does it actually work? 

We just a bunch of function, these functions don't return anything.
But yet something is rendered on the screen, and in a very fast, optimized way.
How does it actually work?

Now, brace yourselves.
