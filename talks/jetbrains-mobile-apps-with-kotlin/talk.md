# Notes

I have 2 hours, with a break in between. It's quite a lot of time.

Talk with 2 parts:
- practical "DIY" part when we all build an app together
- more lecture-y part how does it actually work under the hood

# Part 1 (coding)

## 00:00 – 00:10 — Introduction & Setup

Now, mobile development is known for requiring much heavier tooling than
frontend – so I'll introduce myself real quick, then we'll quickly download
Android Studio, and in the meantime I'll say a bit about JetBrains.
## 00:10 – 00:30 — Kotlin Basics (Fast-Paced)

Use Kotlin by Example for it: https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample

### Variables, types, null safety

### Functions, lambdas

### Extension functions

### Data classes and sealed classes

Special Classes > Data Classes
Special Classes > Sealed Classes

> Keep it tight — goal is just familiarity, not mastery.



Pro-tips:

- Read documentation – hover over functions!


Basic layout blocks:
- Text
- Button
- Column/Row
  - layout algorithm very similar to Flutter

- Basic styling with Modifier
