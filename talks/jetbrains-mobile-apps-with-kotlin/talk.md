# Notes

I have 2 hours, with a break in between. It's quite a lot of time.

Talk with 2 parts:
- practical "DIY" part when we all build an app together
- more lecture-y part how does it actually work under the hood

# Part 1 (coding)

## 00:00 – 00:10 — Introduction & Setup

Now, mobile development is known for requiring much heavier tooling than
frontend – so I'll introduce myself real quick, then we'll quickly download
Android Studio, and in the meantime I'll say a bit about JetBrains.

### About JetBrains

We have internships.
It's quite unfortunate because they just finished last week.
Please sign up for a new edition 
- We're looking for a student ambassador at FEUP

## 00:10 – 00:30 — Kotlin Basics (Fast-Paced)

Use Kotlin by Example for it: https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample

### Variables, types, null safety

### Functions, lambdas

### Extension functions

### Data classes and sealed classes

Special Classes > Data Classes
Special Classes > Sealed Classes

> Keep it tight — goal is just familiarity, not mastery.

# Part 2 (internals)

But don't you wonder how does it actually work? 

We just a bunch of function, these functions don't return anything.
But yet something is rendered on the screen, and in a very fast, optimized way.
How does it actually work?

Now, brace yourselves.
