# Mobile development with the expressive power of Kotlin

* quick intro to Kotlin features (compare to Java)
* philosophy (practical language, engineered for productivity)

Show sample Jetpack Compose code / HTML builders code - this is what we will build.

* functions with receiver
* extension functions
* scopes and receivers
* TODO: more
* possible extra topics for the end:
  * reified generics
  * tailrec optimization?

# Problems

## Overall question
Hey Marton:)

I'll be giving a talk in Porto at a conference for CS students. The title is "Building mobile apps with the expressive power of Kotlin".

I wonder
Android Studio is a pretty heavy IDE
Fleet is slow and not ready for Compose Multiplatform

## Pre-requirements

Hi!

I'm excited to see you tomorrow in B117 at FEUP!

**To not loose too much time on setup during the workshop**, here's some stuff
that I recommend you get done beforehand:

- Install the latest IntelliJ IDEA (preferably Ultimate), or Android Studio
- If you have GitHub Student Pack, that's perfect! Then you have IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate for free.
  If not, then Android Studio is fine too!

If you want to make _extra sure_ that everything will be fine, open IntelliJ (or Android Studio) and:
1. create a new project (Android > Phone & Tablet > Empty Activity)
2. Click through "Next", "Next", "Next", agree to everything
3. Once project gets created, click the green run button and hopefully see the app opening on Android emulator

If you're having any problems, feel free to text here:)


I'll try to also showcase a new AI coding agent from JetBrains – Junie (https://www.jetbrains.com/junie) – and vibe code a little:)
I have enough codes for everyone to join

But Junie works only in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, not Android Studio, and that's the only reason I recommend the former, not the latter.
