# Mobile development with the expressive power of Kotlin

* quick intro to Kotlin features (compare to Java)
* philosophy (practical language, engineered for productivity)

Show sample Jetpack Compose code / HTML builders code - this is what we will build.

* extension functions
* functions with receiver
* scopes and receivers
* TODO: more
* possible extra topics for the end:
  * reified generics
  * tailrec optimization?

Fleet is slow and not ready for Compose Multiplatform
