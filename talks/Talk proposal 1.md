# Accessibility and UI testing – two sides of the same coin?

### Description

Accessibility and UI testing are two very important, but seemingly unrelated concepts in Flutter app development - but what if I told you that they're closely coupled?

---

Accessibility is no longer just an option - regulations such as the European Accessibility Act (EAA) mandate that a huge range of products and services must be accessible to people with disabilities. EAA will become law in all of EU in June 2025, and if you're a developer working on an app, you'll most likely have to add accessibility support.

This might sound like a yet another boring task, but I suggest you change your perspective and look at it as an opportunity – because well-implemented accessibility makes end-to-end UI testing easy and mostly effortless.

Why? If you think about how an end-to-end UI test really works, you'll see many parallels to the way people with disabilities interact with their devices using systems such as VoiceOver.

In this lightning talk, you'll learn how to take advantage of your Flutter app being accessible to develop end-to-end UI tests with almost no effort.

I'm a software developer and Computer Science student with a few years of expertise in Flutter, both in app and tooling development. I was the main developer of the Patrol testing framework (I gave a talk about it on last year's Fluttercon).

I'm also a member of the #flutter-hackers group (people with commit access in the Flutter org on GitHub), and over the past year I've made almost 100 pull requests and issues, mainly related to Flutter's integration with Gradle on Android and better support for UI testing. I also maintain several popular projects in the Flutter ecosystem, such as package:location and the Flutter GitHub Action, and have contributed to many more throughout the years. Currently I'm working at mobile.dev, where we're building what's next for UI testing.
