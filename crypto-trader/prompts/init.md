# cryptotrader

I want to learn more about cryptocurrency trading, specifically ETH.

Features: Build a small CLI program that sends some ETH between 2 accounts.

If accounts don't exist yet, allow creating them.

Use the Go programming language.

### end goal

I want to be able to see the transactions between the 2 accounts on https://sepolia.etherscan.io.

Does this plan make sense? Please be my advisor and friendly lecturer.
